# AaryanBatra.github.io

This is my Github hosted website and was my first project working with HTML. I messed around with formatting and fonts and embedded a Spotify playlist containing the song "Location" 
by Playboi Carti as a little joke going off of the previous line on the website. I plan to add more creative design elements to it in the future.
